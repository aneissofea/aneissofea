## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sofea, a self-taught developer based in KL, Malaysia.

My background was Mechanical Engineering and I discovered my passion for programming after always wanting to see the algorithm/pattern behind things, and feeling smart in my coding classes. It is the only time I feel logical. âœ¨ I love using my creativity to connect people. Being self-taught was challenging, but I'm motivated by the excitement of learning new things and overcoming unfamiliar challenges. 

You may take a look in my [gist](https://gist.github.com/aneissofea) as i have not yet finished any big project, so my code snippets might help you see my understanding of my work.
